          <div class="editor-js-block">
            <p>
              Spotify was founded in 2006 in Stockholm, Sweden by Daniel Ek and
              Martin Lorentzon. The name is a combination of "spot" and
              "identify."
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="editor-js-block">
            <p>
              Ek was a music fan frustrated by piracy, seeing an opportunity to
              create a legal alternative to music piracy services like Napster
              and Kazaa. Lorentzon was the co-founder of TradeDoubler, an online
              marketing company that had just been acquired.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="editor-js-block">
            <p>
              The two had a vision to create a platform that would make all the
              world's music available in a simple, affordable way. Their goal
              was to convince music fans to pay a monthly fee for legal music
              streaming rather than pirating.
            </p>

          <div class="editor-js-block">

              After two years of negotiations, Spotify secured the licensing
              rights from all the major record labels - Universal, Sony BMG, EMI
              Music, and Warner Music. This allowed Spotify to launch in Europe
              in 2008 with a catalog of over 5 million songs.
            </p>

          <div class="editor-js-block">
            <p>
              Spotify launched with two options - a free ad-supported tier and a
              premium ad-free subscription tier for €9.99 per month. The free
              tier was initially invitation-only to control growth.

            <p>
              Spotify grew rapidly across Europe, hitting 1 million paying
              subscribers by March 2009 and 2.5 million by September 2010.

              In July 2011, after years of negotiations with record labels,
              Spotify launched in the crucial U.S. market. This was a major
              milestone, as the U.S. represented the largest market for recorded
              music.

          <div class="editor-js-block">
            <p>
              Spotify's U.S. launch was boosted by a high-profile partnership
              with Facebook that allowed users to share their music activity on
              the social network. Mark Zuckerberg personally promoted Spotify on
              his Facebook page.

              By the end of 2011, just 5 months after the U.S. launch, Spotify
              had over 2.5 million paying subscribers globally.

              Over the next several years, Spotify continued its rapid global
              expansion, launching in many new markets across Asia, Latin
              America, and the Middle East.

              In 2012, Spotify removed the invitation requirement for the free

              Spotify launched a browser-based web player in 2012, followed by
              apps for tablets, smartphones, TVs, cars and other devices over
              the next few years.

              New subscription tiers were added, including Spotify Family in
              2014 and a hi-fi lossless audio tier in 2017. Video content was
              also added briefly before being discontinued.

              In April 2018, after months of speculation, Spotify went public in
              an unusual direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange, avoiding
              the traditional IPO process. The listing valued Spotify at over
              $26 billion.

              In 2019, Spotify made a major strategic move into podcasting with
              the acquisitions of Gimlet Media, Anchor and Parcast. This kicked
              off an aggressive podcasting investment strategy.

              Over the next few years, Spotify acquired numerous other podcast

              signed exclusive deals with popular podcasters like Joe Rogan,

              It faces increasing competition from Apple Music, Amazon Music,
